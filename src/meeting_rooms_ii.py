253. Meeting Rooms II

https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms-ii

NOTES
  * Maintain a min-heap of meeting end times. The minimum (earliest) end time
    is the root node (heap invariant). If the end time of the root node is less
    than or equal to the start time of the current node, delete the root node
    from the heap. Insert the meeting end time into the heap. This is roughly
    equivalent to allocating/deallocating conference rooms for each meeting.
    The minimum number of conference rooms required is then the maximum size of
    the heap.

I really love this oneâ€“mainly due to the elegant use of a heap and because I
just love heaps <3.
