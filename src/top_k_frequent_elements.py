347. Top K Frequent Elements

https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements

NOTES
  * Use a heap or the quickselect algorithm.

Once you understand heaps (and the quickselect algorithm), this class of
problems becomes trivial.

If you see *kth smallest*, *k closest*, or *top k* mentioned in a question, it
typically means the problem can be solved using a heap. The general approach to
solving these problems involves maintaining a max- or min-heap of size k. The
kth smallest value is the root of the max-heap. The kth largest value is the
root of the min-heap. To retrieve all k smallest (or largest) elements, simply
return the sorted heap.

Though a heap offers O(nlog k) time complexity, the quickselect algorithm
solves this problem in linear time (O(n)).

    solution.

    Return the top k frequent elements using the quickselect algorithm.

    Quickselect (also known as Hoare's selection algorithm) is a selection
    algorithm to find the kth smallest (or largest) element in an unordered
    list of n elements.

    Since quickselect returns the kth element in the list, elements less than k
    are guaranteed to be less than (or greater than) k. Thus allowing us to
    return the top k frequent elements in any order.

    This solution has O(n) average-case and O(n^2) worst-case time complexity.

    NOTE: Instead of finding the (n - k)th element, we simply reverse the
    comparison in the `partion()` function, since quickselect typically puts
    elements in ascending order.
