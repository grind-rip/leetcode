104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree

This problem can be solved using breadth-first search or depth-first search,
since we will by necessity have to visit each node in the binary tree, however
it is more intuitive to use depth-first search.

NOTE: Since a binary tree is not cyclic, we do not need to maintain a list of
visited nodes.

If the binary tree is a perfect binary tree[^1], then its depth is 2^x = n + 1,
where x is the depth and n is the length of the array representing
the binary tree. This is also x = logâ‚‚(n + 1).

[^1]: A perfect binary tree is a binary tree in which all interior nodes have
two children and all leaves have the same depth or same level (the level of a
node defined as the number of edges or links from the root node to a node).
