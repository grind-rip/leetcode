217. Contains Duplicate

https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate

NOTES
  * Easy hash map problem.

If one were to use an O(n^2) solution, this would produce "Time Limit Exceeded"
on LeetCode. Usually, if an algorithm is O(n^2), LeetCode will allow `n` up to
around 10^4. A solution will produce "Time Limit Exceeded" when n â‰¥ 10^5.
